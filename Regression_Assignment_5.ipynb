    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression model that combines the L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge) techniques to overcome some of the limitations associated with each of them. It was developed to address issues related to multicollinearity and feature selection that can arise in traditional linear regression models.\n",

    "Interpreting the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression is similar to interpreting coefficients in other linear regression models. However, because Elastic Net combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, the interpretation can be a bit nuanced. Here are some key points to keep in mind when interpreting the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Magnitude of Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude (absolute value) of a coefficient indicates its importance in predicting the target variable. Larger absolute values suggest stronger associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sign of Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign (positive or negative) of a coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship. A positive coefficient means an increase in the predictor variable is associated with an increase in the target variable, while a negative coefficient suggests the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Zero Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net, some coefficients may be exactly zero, especially when L1 regularization (Lasso) is dominant. This means that those features have been excluded from the model. Zero coefficients indicate that the corresponding predictor variables do not contribute to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Coefficient Stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coefficients in Elastic Net are influenced by the regularization strength (α) and the balance between L1 and L2 regularization (ρ). Changing these hyperparameters can impact the magnitude and direction of coefficients.\n",
    "- Coefficients that are stable across a range of hyperparameter values are generally more reliable in interpretation.\n",

    "##### Sharing Models:\n",
    "Pickled models can be easily shared with other team members, collaborators, or researchers. This facilitates knowledge transfer and collaboration in machine learning projects.\n",
